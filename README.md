This project focuses on deploying a dynamic web application on AWS using infrastructure as code with Terraform, containerization with Docker, and container orchestration with Amazon ECS and ECR. The application is hosted within a scalable and secure environment, leveraging a 3-tier VPC architecture to separate the web, application, and database layers.

The deployment process includes setting up various AWS resources, such as Route 53 for DNS management, RDS for database services, S3 for storage, DynamoDB for state locking, and IAM roles for secure access management. Auto-scaling is enabled to ensure that the application can handle varying loads, and SSL certificates are managed through AWS Certificate Manager to secure communications.

This project is designed to automate the deployment process, making it efficient and reproducible, and is well-suited for production environments where scalability, security, and high availability are essential. It can be further enhanced by integrating CI/CD pipelines, advanced monitoring and logging, and additional security measures like WAF and Secrets Manager.

The architecture is flexible and can be adapted for various web applications, providing a strong foundation for modern cloud-based deployments.
